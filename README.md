codefundo++ project by Digvijay Singh
## Aim: To prevent Massive Epidemic Outbreaks
## Idea:
The past decade has seen the spread of various dangerous communicable diseases such HIV AIDS, H1N1 Swine Flu, Nipah Virus,etc. The best way to keep people safe is to help them minimize contact with the already infected people. The desired aim of this project can be described through the following example :
Suppose that, person X contracts a communicable disease. If it is even slightly dangerous, X will definitely go to a Hospital. The plan is to have an Android app installed in X's mobile phone. The application mainly stores X's medical proforma- mainly a list of the communicable diseases X is infected with, the level of infection, and the duration of infection. The hospital authorities will have a unique code, that will allow them to make changes to X's medical proforma, with his consent. Now, if a person Y comes in X's proximity, and if he has the app installed in his phone, the phones will exchange information about their owner's infection status. This will be done through DTNs (Disruption Tolerant Networks), via Bluetooth. As a result, Y will be warned about the possibility of getting infected, which will be high if the disease is highly infectious. Next if any person Z comes in close proximity to Y, assuming that Z's phone has the app installed, Z will be warned too, although his chances of infection will be shown as less than that of Y. 
The app will use GPS to get a person's geographical location and warn him about reported epidemics in the vicinity. It will also deploy cloud computing to store information about the various communicable diseases, their symptoms, etc. This information, along with the nearest hospital location will be shared with the person if he has more than a certain risk level of contracting an infection. The timely warnings and treatment will save many lives.
